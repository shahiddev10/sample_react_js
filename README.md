# Demo Application

Application is setup for prospective customers. This allows sales personnel to have
something more applicable to the prospective customer's needs than traditional collateral, such as
a Power Point presentation.

2. When we click on a Task a model will pop up showing relevant information associated with that
data item.

- A List of “Cards” showing “Latest Tasks” laid out similar to Figure A below.

- Each “card” should highlight when you hover your mouse cursor over it.
